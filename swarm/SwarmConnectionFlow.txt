This is a rough outline of how the existing GO version connects to the swarm. This was engineered by parsing log files. So some details may be missing
or inaccurate.

Conneting to the swarm:

0) Network connection

1) Negotiate Multistream

2) Negotiate secio

3) Negotiate Multistream over secio

4) Negotiate yamux over multistrem over secio. They should reply with the yamux protocol id. Then there are about 6 streams. It appears that odd number
streams are opened by the "client" and even numbered streams by the "server". 

It does not seem that these streams are synchronized with one another, although each stream must complete its transmission before another can be sent
(i.e. yamux header + all data must be sent before another stream can use the connection)

The miscellaneous bytes sent still have to be sorted as to why and when they should be sent.

Stream 1: Us sending the ID protocol and ID message
Send a Window Update
They will send one back
Send multistream protocol id (18 bytes) plus \n (1 byte)
Send id protocol (?? bytes) plus \n (1 byte)
Receive ID protocol back (16 bytes)
Receive 2 bytes (167, 4) (not sure why just yet)
Receive 551 bytes (with yamux header) must be the id protocol blob
Receive window update 

Stream 2: // them sending the ID protocol and ID message
They send us a window update
We send one back
We send the multistream protocol id (18 bytes) plus \n (1 byte)
They send the multistream protocol id back
They send us the id protocol id
We send the protocol id back
We send a yamux header with 2 bytes, {161, 4}
We send a yamux header with 545 bytes
We send a window update
We receive a window update

Stream 3: // us setting up the kademlia protocol
Send a window update
They will send one back
We receive a multistream protocol id
We send a yamux protocol id
We send a multistream protocol id
We send a yamux header with 1 byte (16)
We send a kad protocol id
We receive the kad protocol id back
We send a window update

Stream 4: // them setting up the circuit relay protocol
They send us a window update
We send one back
We send the multistream protocol
We receive the yamux header with 1 bytes (19)
We receive the multistream protocol id
We receive the yamux header with 1 byte (28)
We receive the circuit relay protocol id
We send the circuit relay protocol id back
We recieve the yamux header with 1 byte (2)
We receive the yamux header with 2 bytes (8, 4)
We send the value 5 back
We then send the values { 8, 3, 32, 142, 2 }
We send a window update
We receive a window update

Stream 5: // us setting up the circuit relay protocol
We send a window update
We receive a window update
We receive the multistream protocol id
We send the multistream protocol id
We send a yamux header with 1 byte (28)
We send the circuit relay protocol id
We receive the circuit relay protocol id back
We send the value (2)
We send a yamux header with 2 decimals (8, 2)
We read a yamux header with 1 decimal (5)
We read a yamux header with 5 decimals (8, 3, 32, 142, 2)
We receive a window update
We send a window update

Stream 6: // them setting up the kademlia protocol
We receive a window update
We send them a window update
We send the multistream protocol id
We received the decimal (19)
We receive the multistream protocol id
We receive the decimal (16)
We receive the kad protocol id
We send the kad protocol id back
We receive a winodw update
We send a window update
